# Write a User Story:
The app I chose to use for the User Story is a shopping app called Shein.  
The feature I’m choosing to focus on for this User Story is the categories feature.
* As a user, I can see and scroll through all the categories from the main page.
  * Acceptance Criteria:
    * Each category should have a sample picture of the of what is in the category. 
    * Each category is clickable and should have sub-categories.
    * Popular categories are marked in some way.
    * The category list has scrollable navigation for parsing all categories
 * As a user, when I click on a category, I can immediately see all available options in   that category.
	* Acceptance Criteria:
		* Scrollable pictures and prices for each option
		* Sale items clearly marked
		* Best sellers clearly marked
		* Available subcategories visible and scrollable in page  
* As a user I can click on subcategories to further refine my search
	* Acceptance Criteria:
      * Subcategories bring up that particular option within the main category (example: main           category “women” subcategory “tops” bring up only woman’s tops.) 
      * A filter to refine search by colour, size, pattern, style, price, etc.
      * As a user I can filter my search by product type, category, size, style, colour, sleeve length, pattern type, neckline, material, sleeve type and price range.
	* Acceptance criteria:
		* Each filter refinement item should be a drop-down menu.
		* Price range should be an adjustable bar with two points for min and max values.
* As a user I can access all these categories from the search bar
	* Acceptance Criteria:
		* Have categories come up immediately when search is pressed
		* Be able to search by subcategories 
		* Be able to search by filter items (red for example)
		* Have previous searches available on screen as clickable buttons
 

		* Have suggested or trending searches available on screen.
* As a user I can take a picture of something and see it or similar products in the categories.
	* Acceptance Criteria:
		* Camera icon available in search bar
		* Ability to access phone camera
		* Notification on camera screen asking to point at the product.
		* Auto scan when a product is detected and auto search for it.

# Research a new language: Haskell
While researching Haskell, it took me first to an interesting concept of functional programming. Using purely functions. While I am familiar with functions as we use them quite a bit, the idea of building something purely out of functions was an interesting concept. The idea of pure function that do not modify variables, but they instead return new ones. Being able to focus on results, not the process by using expressions and declarations rather than execution of statements, the use of conditional expressions and recursion instead of loops and value output not depending on a local or global state, only the arguments passed to the function. However functional programming, while a nice little rabbit hole, was not the reason for the research. So honestly the first question I had to ask myself was “what is Haskell?”, beyond it being a programming language, I knew nothing about it. 

Well it turns out Haskell is a purely functional programming language. The programs in Haskell are always written as mathematical functions which have no side effects. It seems to be mainly used in research and academia however it is also used in a number of companies. Its application range is huge, ranging from being used in aerospace all the way to social media and hardware design, and has recently become popular in tech companies due to its high security.

The benefits of Haskell seem to be:
* that it uses “lazy” evaluation, meaning that things only get evaluated if they are needed which can lead to faster programs.
* It includes automatic memory management to make it memory safe and avoid memory leaks and overflows.
* if facilitates clean, more reliable code that will lead to shorter development time, scalability and eases refactoring.
### What is the language used for?
With Haskell’s mathematical functional programming, it seems to be most used in industrial and financial applications, but its security is making it popular in other industries as well, such as teaching, research, social media and more. Its uses are many but mostly it’s a great choice of language when you need to do precise mappings of mathematical algorithms.
### Who uses the language?
While I could simply answer this question with “programmers” I feel maybe a little more detail should be added.  
From adjoint to zoomin software, there are hundreds of companies currently using Haskell.  
The biggest of them probably being Microsoft. Microsoft uses Haskell for its production serialization system, Bond. Microsoft research has separately been a key sponsor of Haskell Development since the late 1900s. (I write that like the late 1900s wasn’t less than 30 years ago)

### what are some useful resources
Haskell itself has put together numerous resources that would be helpful to anyone wanting to learn a new programming language at https://www.haskell.org/documentation/. Most of them are free but there are of few listed resources that are behind a paywall.  
However they have everything from books, online resources, courses, tutorials and more.
### Why are these specific resources useful?
Why are they useful? Who better to teach you about the language then those who are developing it? With their exhaustive list of resources your bound to find one that works well for your understanding and level of knowledge.

# Choose a language for the Community Code

The language I would like to focus on for the community code project would be JavaScript.
While I have absolutely no prior programming knowledge beyond learning Java last semester and only have half a semester of JavaScript knowledge so far, I am interested in developing that knowledge further and using it in more projects in a meaningful way.
The reason I would like to learn more about JavaScript is I can see its practical uses in web development. It would be a handy knowledge base to have moving forward with this course as well as for pet projects I develop along the way. Web development is always something I’ve been interested in, and I can see JavaScript being useful for that.
