## Research a new language: Haskell
While researching Haskell, it took me first to an interesting concept of functional programming. Using purely functions. While I am familiar with functions as we use them quite a bit, the idea of building something purely out of functions was an interesting concept. The idea of pure function that do not modify variables, but they instead return new ones. Being able to focus on results, not the process by using expressions and declarations rather than execution of statements, the use of conditional expressions and recursion instead of loops and value output not depending on a local or global state, only the arguments passed to the function. However functional programming, while a nice little rabbit hole, was not the reason for the research. So honestly the first question I had to ask myself was “what is Haskell?”, beyond it being a programming language, I knew nothing about it. 

Well it turns out Haskell is a purely functional programming language. The programs in Haskell are always written as mathematical functions which have no side effects. It seems to be mainly used in research and academia however it is also used in a number of companies. Its application range is huge, ranging from being used in aerospace all the way to social media and hardware design, and has recently become popular in tech companies due to its high security.

The benefits of Haskell seem to be:
* that it uses “lazy” evaluation, meaning that things only get evaluated if they are needed which can lead to faster programs.
* It includes automatic memory management to make it memory safe and avoid memory leaks and overflows.
* if facilitates clean, more reliable code that will lead to shorter development time, scalability and eases refactoring.
#### What is the language used for?
With Haskell’s mathematical functional programming, it seems to be most used in industrial and financial applications, but its security is making it popular in other industries as well, such as teaching, research, social media and more. Its uses are many but mostly it’s a great choice of language when you need to do precise mappings of mathematical algorithms.
#### Who uses the language?
While I could simply answer this question with “programmers” I feel maybe a little more detail should be added.  
From adjoint to zoomin software, there are hundreds of companies currently using Haskell.  
The biggest of them probably being Microsoft. Microsoft uses Haskell for its production serialization system, Bond. Microsoft research has separately been a key sponsor of Haskell Development since the late 1900s. (I write that like the late 1900s wasn’t less than 30 years ago)

#### what are some useful resources
Haskell itself has put together numerous resources that would be helpful to anyone wanting to learn a new programming language at https://www.haskell.org/documentation/. Most of them are free but there are of few listed resources that are behind a paywall.  
However they have everything from books, online resources, courses, tutorials and more.
#### Why are these specific resources useful?
Why are they useful? Who better to teach you about the language then those who are developing it? With their exhaustive list of resources your bound to find one that works well for your understanding and level of knowledge.
#### Resources for my research on Haskell.

## Choose a language for the Community Code

The language I would like to focus on for the community code project would be JavaScript.
While I have absolutely no prior programming knowledge beyond learning Java last semester and only have half a semester of JavaScript knowledge so far, I am interested in developing that knowledge further and using it in more projects in a meaningful way.
The reason I would like to learn more about JavaScript is I can see its practical uses in web development. It would be a handy knowledge base to have moving forward with this course as well as for pet projects I develop along the way. Web development is always something I’ve been interested in, and I can see JavaScript being useful for that.


# Week 9 – Research and Reflection Activities

## How to contribute to open source
What I have learned about open source contributions is that its not limited to simply coding. There are many things that a person can do to help contribute to open source projects, from event planning and helping organize meet ups and conferences, help with design and improving layout, usability or even help design t-shirts. Theres opportunities to help with writing, reviews, testing, organizing and its not limited to just software projects.
I also learned valuable ways and information about how to go about submitting a contribution, giving proper context, gathering context, opening issues and pull requests and what to expect once I have made a contribution. All in all the article will be very helpful moving forward. 
Knowing I’m not limited to helping with just coding, I’m looking forward to seeing what other contributions I can help with and am particularly interested in helping with writing, user testing, and possibly design as well as any help I might be able to provide in code review or implementation.  

## Find potential projects to contribute to

As someone who is starting to appreciate clean and reliable code, I’m interested in contributing to a project that provides essential tools for validating and sanitizing strings.  

## Explore community connections  

While some of the projects I chose are definitely prime for community connections, actually finding them was a task and a half.
While I was most excited to see what was happing in the Public Happiness Movement discussions, every link I found for their community was broken. While I still plan on hunting it down, for the time being it’s taken a back seat.
This section is turning out to be a little more bare than I intended, as I have been having trouble finding communities for the other projects I chose, however I’m leaving this part in here so I can fill it out a little better later in the week when I have had a greater opportunity to look for them.

I’m actually quite excited to see what others have said and are doing in the communities for these projects and look forward to being able to contribute.  


## Identify issues to support

**Project – Public happiness movement**  

For this particular pick, they don’t have their issues posted to github, but on their site.

**URL**  

https://publichappinessmovement.com/t/topic/2597

**Description of the issue**  

The issue focuses on increasing the visibility and prominence of buttons in posts on the map. The primary goal is to encourage users to engage with the map by interacting with three specific forum threads. Currently, these threads are not prominint enough, hindering user engagement. 

**Contribution Plan**  

To address the issue, I plan too “
 * take a look at the current user interface to identify elements contributing to the lack of prominence.
* propose and implement a design that enhances and draws attention to the forum threads.
* collaborating with the UX team to gather feedback and refine the design for optimal user engagement.
  
**Project – Rocket.Chat**  

**URL**  

https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues/24917  

**Description of the Issue**  

The current issue is the limitation of the emoji picker, which currently supports only Emoji 12. The existing emojis are sourced from a discontinued npm package emojione, found in the dev dependencies.  

**Contribution Plan**  

* check to see if the newer emoji toolkit meets the requirements and is compatible with the existing project setup
* replace the outdated emojione package with the emoji tookit package
* ensure the emoji picker reflects the latest emojis, encluding emoji 12 and newer, based on the package.
* document the update process and changes made for future reference and maintenance.


**Project – Validator.js**  

**URL**  

https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js/issues/1761  

**Description of the issue**  

The current issue seems to be that not all the countries are listed in the isMobilePhone validator.js library. Currently there are validations for less than 195 countries, currently only 157 are listed.   

**Contribution Plan**  

* Choose a country without an existing validation
* implement the new validation for the chosen country
* updating the isMobilePhone section in the README to reflect the changes
* check existing PRs to ensure the chosen country doesn’t already have a pending PR


## Follow up Questions and Reflections
1.	What is the most surprising thing that you’ve learned about open source development and/or open source communities during your research this week?
* For me the most surprising thing was that contributing to open source material doesn’t necessarily focus on programming or code, but a multitude of different opportunities to help develop the product.
It was also surprising to find that a lot of the communities were actually quite kind, welcoming and not the toxic pit I have come to expect from open communications on the web.
2.	What types of open source projects do you find yourself most drawn to? Is there an obvious connection between them?  
* While the ones I am currently most drawn too are centered around design or UI/UX, anything that allows me to see a marked difference when completed is what really connects them. It doesn’t have to just be in UX/UI, even in programming, if I walk away and something is different because I was there then it makes me happy.
3.	Is the programming language that you chose last week still the right choice? Should you consider alternatives?
* For my current experience and knowledge base I still think JavaScript was the right choice so far, though it has stopped me from engaging in a couple of issues that focused more on other languages, I would rather play with the equipment I currently have an understanding of rather than trying to learn a new language on the fly as I try and complete these tasks.

# Week 10 - Research and Reflection Activities  

## Replacing an Issue  
After condsidering what needed to be done for this particular course, it came to my attention that The Happiness Movement wasnt going to be a viable project to work on.  
Instead I found a new issue to replace The Happiness Movement.  

**URL for new issue**  
https://github.com/SSENSE/vue-carousel/issues/385  

**Description of the issue**  
The issue focuses on how there is a build up of event listeners on the window object when a page is navigated to and away from multiple times via routing.  

To adress the issue I plan too:  
* look at the code and see where the event listeners are handled and if they have a corosponding remove event listener attached.
* add remove event listener where appropriate in the code.

  **on reflection**  
There is alot, and I mean ALOT of code for that particular page and finding all the event listeners and where to remove them is not at all obvious with my minimal coding knowlege. This one may require a little more time and understanding to complete. Simply going through it wont be enough as there is thousands of lines of code and im not really sure how they all relate to eachother.

## Follow up Questions and reflections  

The question this week was what is the hardest/ most challenging thing you had to do this week for DGL 104 and how did i overcome this challenge.  

Well, I had a few challenges. It was hard to pick one so I listed two.  
1. **Time**: It takes me twice as long to complete most of these activties than the listed completetion time. Without having actually worked on any of the coding projects, merely setting them up as well as setting up and completeing the md file for the journal, not to mention looking at the code for the indvidual issues I selected to see which one I could conceivably tackle this week and going through all the videos and making sure I was doing things correctly, it took me most of one day just to get set up properly.  
**How I overcame this challenge**  
Honestly, I took time off work so I had an extra day in my week to work on school things. I'm confident that what I have left to do for this class this week wont take up a whole day, but incase it does I dont want be trying to make it up after 7pm on a sunday.

2. **Knowledge**: After looking through the code for some of the issues I chose it became apparent to me that I'm as knowlegble as John Snow (I really know nothing). My basic JavaScript knowlege is not going to help me alot for these issues and theres alot of research im going to have to do if the plan is to accomplish work on all three. Its a little overwhelming to see code that thousands and thousands of lines long and trying to fix one issue in it.  
**How I overcame this challenge**  
I havent really. Yet. This week I simply focused on one of the easier issues to digest and that honestly helped boost my confidence for the rest of them. I know I can do this if I really put my mind to it. I do love coding and learning and overcomming challenges so my plan going forward is to look at the longer codes in smaller chunks and see if I can understand or at least FIND what im supposed to be looking for. I know this will take hours over multiple days and im simply hoping that its infact doable.

# Week 11 Follow up questions and reflections  

**Determin if my chosen programming language is OOP capable.**  

Well, lets take a closer look at OOP and determin if JavaScript supports OOP and to what extent.  
1. **Classes and Objects:**  
* In JavaScript, classes were introduced in ES6 to provide a more structured way to create objects and deal with inheritance.
* Classes in JavaScript are primarily syntactical sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance model.
* Example:
```
class person{
constructor(name, age){
this.name = name;
this.age = age;
}
function greet(){
return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`;
}
}
const john = new Person('John', 30);
console.log(john.greet());// should output: Hello my name is John and im 30 years old.
```

2. **Encapsulation:**
* JavaScript support encapsulation through closures and module patterns, as well as through the use of classes and access modifiers, like ```private``` fields.
* Encapsulation is achieved by defining private variables and methods inside closures or classes and exposing only the necessary functionalities through public methods.

3. **Inheritance**
* inheritance in JavaScript is implemented through prototype chaining.
* When ES6 introduced the ```class``` syntax, it made it easier to work with inheritance
* Example:
```
class Animal{
constructor(name){
this.name = name;
}
speak(){
return `${this.name} makes a sound.`;
}
}
class Dog extends Animal{
speak(){
return `${this.name} barks.`;
}
}
const dog = new Dog('Buddy');
consol.log(dog.speak());// should output: Buddy barks.
```
4. **Polymorphism:**
* Polymorphism in JavaScript is achieved through method overriding and dynamic method resolution.
* Example of using method overriding:
```
class Shape{
draw(){
return 'Drawing a shape';
}
}
class Circle extends Shape{
draw(){
return 'Drawing a circle';
}
}
conts shape = new Circle();
console.log(shape.draw());
```
5. **Abstraction:**
* JavaScript supports abstraction through the use of classes, closures and functions.
* Abstraction is achieved by hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential functionalities.

6. **Association, Aggregation and Composition:**  
* in JavaScript, association, aggregation and composition are modeled similarly to other object-oriented languages.
* They are represented through object references and can be implemented using classes or plain objects
* Example using composition:
```
class Engine{
start(){
return 'Engine started';
}
}
class Car{
constructor(){
this.engine = new Engine();
}
startEngine(){
return this.engine.start();
}
}
const car = new Car();
console.log(car.startEngine());
```
In conclusion I feel that JavaScript employs quite a bit of OOP principles to organize code into reusable and modular components.
